    <dl>
        <dt>TCP</dt>
            <dd>
                TCP, or Transmission Control Protocol, is a fundamental protocol in internet communication that ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications on networked devices.
            </dd>
        <dt>IP</dt>
            <dd>
                An IP, or Internet Protocol, address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It's essentially a digital address that allows devices to send and receive information across networks, similar to how a mailing address allows mail to be delivered. 
            </dd>
        <dt>FTP</dt>
            <dd>
                FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. It is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between computers over a TCP/IP network, like the internet. Essentially, it's a way for computers to exchange files, allowing users to upload, download, and manage files on remote servers.  
            </dd>
        <dt>HTTP</dt>
            <dd>
                HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the foundational protocol for transmitting data on the internet, enabling the retrieval of web pages and other resources. It operates on a client-server model, where a client (like a web browser) sends a request, and the server responds with the requested data.
